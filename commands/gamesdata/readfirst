Thank you, friends, for helping me test out this little looking-for-games bot I cooked up!

**__Instructions__**
1. Add yourself to a list! Post: **!games sfv 2.5**
*That adds you to the **SFV** list for **2.5 hours***

2. You can specify a platform! Post **!games tekken 2.5 xbox**
*You can also specify **PC**, but the bot will default to **PC** anyway :slight_smile:*

3. You can list everyone waiting for all games! Post: **!games**

4. Or just the game you want! **!games sfv**

5. Remove yourself from the list: Post: **!games stop**

Spam as much as you want, cooldowns exist just in case.
!lfg / !games all do the same thing. Use whatever you like.
Post or DM the bot with **!games list**  for a list of games the bot accepts.
**!helpme games** gives a deeper how-to.
